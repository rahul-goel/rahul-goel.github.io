# Six of Crows Duology

I actually wanted to read Six of Crows. People all over the internet said that
Six of Crows Duology is much better than the Shadow and Bone Trilogy and that
one could directly read Six of Crows Duology without even bothering with Shadow
and Bones Trilogy. After reading all this on the internet, I knew that if I
read the Six of Crows Duology first, I wouldn't have enjoyed the Shadow and
Bones Trilogy so I read that first. And then I read Six of Crows. As of now
(while writing this particular paragraph in this blog), I have only read the
first book of the duology that is Six of Crows and I'll write my thoughts about
that. I'll finish this blog after readint the second book and append my
thoughts.


## Six of Crows

The first time I read the title of this book somewhere on the internet, I
thought it would be some horror story with scarecrows.

The story is perfect. The characters are perfect. The book is perfect. It is
better than any movie that involves some kind of heist. The writing style is so
good. I like books written in third person more. But this book took it to the
next level by writing from the perspective of the characters in every new
chapter. At first, I thought that the chapters are named after the characters
but when the names were repeated in new chapters, I realised that the writing
has been done from the mentioned character's perspective. The flashbacks into
the history of the characters and the continuation of the history from another
character's perspective is so smooth (Nina and Matthias, Kaz and Inej).

### Kaz Brekker

He came to the city with his big brother when his father had died. He saw his
big brother die infront of him due to Pekka Rollins. And now he lives to give
Pekka the death he deserves. *Brick by brick.*

He lives by his own principles. He is a friend to all his gang but if you
betray him, he is not going to show you mercy. He is not going to "show" it.
But he is going to be merciful. He appears to be the badass and he is too but
I'm sure he is kind at heart (will probably see this in the second book). He
let Big Bolliger think that he is letting him bleed to death but later he asked
is people to make sure he survives and leaves the city. That was the first hint
towards the person he is inside. He wears an armour to shield his innerself
from the people around him and to protect them and him. He is similar to Will
from The Infernal Devices. He has his own history and secrets which make him
behave the way he does. And even though we've found out a lot of his history,
I'm sure a lot of it remains to found out in the second book and it will be
more than enough to justify his behaviour with others.

And he's a mastermind. Always ten steps ahead of his enemy. Double-crossing the
double-crossers. He did not share the entire plan he had for the heist because
he never does. Telling the plan to others means a chance of leaks and he
doesn't risk it. And he proves his skills by breaching the most protected area
in the world.

He cares for Inej. Just doesn't want to show it. I know there are reasons
behind it - one could be for her own protection. And we read how that turned
out. The moment Van Ek saw Kaz chancing a glance at Inej, he took her. And then
he said one of the most badass lines of the entire book. I don't remember it
but it was something like "I won't let him take my money. I won't let him take
my girl."

And lastly, he carries a cane due to his limp. A cane made by Fabricators with
a crow for the handle. How cool is that? And the cane is all he needs. He knows
the right spots to hit with the cane - the spots for making one numb, for
making one faint or for making on die.

### Inej Ghafa

The Spider for The Dregs. What an amazing character. She was kidnapped from her
parents by pirates and sold to one of the brothels of the city where she was
treated poorly. Then Kaz came to the rescue. Kaz had not heard her approach him
even when she had all those "rining jewels" on. And that had been the only time
he hadn't heard her approach. He had asked Per Haskell to buy her contract from the
brothel and trained her to be the spy for The Dregs. Her movements are so
smooth and silent when she's running across rooftops. She's basically the
Assasin from Assasin's Creed.

And she likes Kaz. She doesn't like liking Kaz but she can't help it. I really
love how she deals with Kaz asking her not to leave. "I will have you without
your armour Kaz, or I won't have you at all."

### Nina Zenik

She might be the my favourite character in the book (I am still confused
between Kaz and her). She is the only trained Grisha in the group and though
her training is in Heartrendering, she helps out the entire group with whatever
healing she knows of. She saved Inej when Inej was fatally hurt. And not to say
she saved everyone of them by consuming *jurda parem* and giving up her own
life (I hope she doesn't die in the second book because of the addiction). And
one can't speak of her without speaking of Matthias. The whole history between
her and Matthias was mind blowing. It was she who changed the beast that
Matthias had become into the boy that he internally was. And her journey with
Matthias after the shipwreck is my favourite part in the book - the little
taunts and teases melting Matthias's heart. And I knew that there had to be a
reason why she gave Matthias to the Kerch authorites and I believe that it was
justified. She had seen the Fjerdan *drüskelle* and she had seen how Ravkans
treated the Fjerdans. And there was no way she was going to hand either one of
them to the other. And what she did was the best possible move.  And I think
Matthias too came to accept the fact that there was no other way out though he
hasn't admitted it.

I really hope the *jurda parem* doesn't do anything to her in the next book.

### Matthias Helvar

Whatever he does is again justified if we look at the things from his
perspective. His parents were *drüskelle*. He did not know whether it was a bad
thing or a good thing to be a *drüskelle*. He had only seen his parents getting
killed by Grisha. Later it was Jarl Brum who had fueled the fire within him and
had made him think that Grisha weren't humans, that they had powers that did
not belong to this earth. He and his friends were powerless common humans and
seeing some alienish power destroy their family would ofcourse have gotten to
him.

In the ship that they had captured the Grisha, he had unkowingly helped Nina
survive by giving her a bucket of water. And giving her the water itself had
been an act of kindness for which he would have served a punishment had he
gotten caught.

And everything from the shipwreck to him ending up in Hellgate had been him
softening slowly just because of Nina. He liked her and admitted that he hated
himself for liking her.

And when he was sent to Hellgate and had came to know of what Nina had done
without knowing why she had done it, his will to kill her was absolutely
justified. He thought that she had double-crossed him and all those weeks of
travel had been just an act and that she was always the witch that he had
thought her to be.

But Nina has stayed for him. She could have left for Ravka but she stayed for
him and her presence and justifications for her acts throughout the heist had
brought him back to his real self once again. The presence of Nina had brought
him to his real self once again.

### Jesper Fahey

Jesper is the funny guy of the gang. When the situation is tensed, he is the
one who relieves everyone by cracking a joke. Not to say about his incredible
skills with a gun in his hand. Kaz might not trust Jesper but he always trusts
his sharpshooting skills.

The bad thing about him is his habit of gambling. He is in debt from every
casino in the Barrel. And it is these debts that drive him most towards the
heist. I don't like that he has lied to his hard-working father (who is a
farmer) about him being in some university studying while all he does is shoot
for The Dregs and gamble whatever money he has.

Even though he always taunts Wylan, he defends him in the final encounter with
Van Eck and throughout the book there are moments where he appreciates Wylan's
skills for the crew. Wylan was always mistreated by his father and Jesper is a
great brotherly figure for him.

### Wylan Eck

The final reveal about him was confusing for me. He can draw and sketch well
but cannot read and write. His disability to read and write is the reason that
his father has abandoned him. Then how can he solve mathematical equations? It
would have been good if things were written from his perspective too (since he
was the only character among the six of them to not have anything written from
his perspective).

Also there was some conversation with Jesper in which he asked something like
"Why only girls?" or something like that. I think it is a hint that he might be
gay. And if he is gay then he might not look at Jesper like a brotherly figure.
So a lot of things have been left out in this part of the story and hopefully
the second book will throw more light in this direction.

Anyway, Wylan was an important character. He helped in the heist by being the
insurance for the money (thought it did not work out) and his sketches and the
bombs he made helped them escape a couple of times.

Later on, Nina under the influence of *jurda parem* tailored his appearance to
match the Kuwei and the change might be permanent. I hope it isn't permanent
though since Jesper doesn't like it.

<br>
<br>

And that is a wrap for the first book. I might not be able to write what I felt
about the characters like this again for the second book. So maybe I'll record
my thoughts after each chapter like I attempted to do with The Mortal
Instruments. Cannot wait to read The Crooked Kingdom.


## Crooked Kingdom

Yeah so I decided writing out my thoughts just after each chapter would be a
good idea to manitain the flow and re-read it anytime later to look back at how
I felt about the story.

### Chapter 1

So Retvenko is a Squaller going for a voyage from Ketterdam to gain some money
which he can use to return to Ravka. But a couple of Shu people (most probably
Grisha under the influence of *jurda parem*) abduct him. Most likely, it is
under Van Eck's orders. Maybe he is trying to build anarmy of Grisha soldires
with extraordinary powers with the help of *jurda parem*.

### Chapter 2

We're back in business with the heist. This chapter is written from Wylan's
perspective. They are stalling Cornelis Smeet to stay at the gambling den so
that Kaz and Wylan can serach his house for documents. Smeet is Van Eck's
lawyer and has all the information on his public and private properties - that
is the possible locations of Inej. Nina is using her charms while Jesper is
gambling his guns to stall him (I hope he doesn't lose them). Anyway, it is
mentioned twice that Nina has recovered from her addiction (not clearly
mentioned but I hope so that's the case). Kaz says he has figured out the
location from their search. The encounter between Kaz and Smet's daughter was
amazing.

### Chapter 3

So the collision between Kaz and Smeet was to plant the whistle back in Smeet's
possession. Typical Kaz. All of them are now there in the cemetry planning
their next move. Kuwei wants to go to Ravka but Kaz insists upon the Southern
Colonies. No one can stop Kaz from getting what he wants. Kaz is so bitter to
Kuwei (I mean he is the same way to everyone else too). I know that all he
wants is to protect the boy but still. My respect goes out to Muzzen. No
mourners. No funerals. I actually was wondering at the end of the first book
that what had happened to him. The Shus, the Fjerdan's, the people from Novyi
Zem and what not are all after Kaz and Kuwei. And Jesper's father turns up? I
hope he is not harmed.

### Chapter 4

Woah. A lot of things happened with Inej. She was brought to some place by Van
Eck where she is being held captive. There's a guy called Bajan who looks after
her meals and well-being. He is Suli like her and is nothing but kind to her.
But Inej doesn't admire his kindness since he is working for Van Eck and all of
it could easily be an act - working with Kaz she has learnt the ways of the
Barrel and of Ketterdam. And most of her doesn't believe that Kaz will come to
rescue her but there's one small part that is still hopeful.

### Chapter 5

Jesper goes to the university with Wylan by his side to meet his father.  There
is a huge contrast in the Barrell and the area around the university. We get to
kow some of Jesper's history. He had come to one of the gambling dens with his
new friends from the university for a night of fun but had failed to turn back
towards the gambling dens since then. As soon as he exchanges greetings with
his father, they get ambushed by some gang (multiple gangs?) and have to run
for their lives through a secret passage that Wylan accidentally knows of.

### Chapter 6

So Jesper's *Da* is brought to their hideout where they all back Jesper against
his father by saying that Jesper and they were mislead into this situation by
someone and they are trying their best to make it right. Kaz assures Jesper's
father that he will set everything alright withing three days of time. Since
this chapter is from Nina's perspective, we gain details of what happened to
her after her first dose of *parem*. She hasn't completely recovered. There are
phases when she craves it and wants to kill anyone denying her *parem* and she
hates herself for her behaviour and her inability to control. There's a moment
when she realises that Jesper is the only one with a family and wishes if
Jesper's *Da* could become a fatherly figure for all of them and take them all
away somewhere far from Ketterdam. This is much relatable to real life. Anyway,
they are approaching the location where Inej is kept and Nina uses some unknown
power to kill the guards (while she was trying her best to just silence them).

### Chapter 7

Comparitively a small chapter. Inej is brought back to the theater room where
Jan Van Eck is going to question her and she is going to stall him. Van Eck
tells her that he has gained information that Kaz and his gang would be
striking their hideout that day to rescue Inej. But Kaz had something else in
mind altogether. While bashing his own son, Jan Van Eck had given away the
knowledge about his young wife and his heir gestating inside her. Kaz had
striked there and kidnapped his pregnant wife. An informant informed them about
this in the theater and the look on Inej's face, her inability to stop laughing
alone was worth al the trouble Kaz went through. A note had been left for Van
Eck stating just the time and place to perform the exchange.

### Chapter 8

Matthias is the main character in this chapter. And he unfolds Kaz's plan to
the reader. When Van Eck had let the intel about his wife slip, Kaz had clung
on to it. The plan was obvious to him. All the protection would be near Inej to
guard her. He would strike where the guard is less. He had searched Smeet's
house for Van Eck's wife's location, not Inej's. And they had done the job. It
had gone smoothly save for one casuality of a guard due to Nina. They were now
preparing for the exchange of Inej with Alys (the wife). Also, everyone finds
Alys irritating but I quite like her. And there had been a moment where Kaz had
warned Wylan by pushing him to the wall and sticking his cane to Wylan's
throat. I hated Kaz for that moment.

### Chapter 9

This one is from Kaz's perspective and is all about the exchange of assets
between the two parties. They exchange on a bridge full of tourists dressed as
characters from Komedie Brute. However Jan Van Eck tries another trick. He
brings stadwatch with him and upon receiving his wife, asks Kaz loudly for his
son Wylan. He acts as if Kaz had kidnapped his family for ransom. But Kaz was
prepared. With the help of Wylan's flash bombs and the characters of Komedie
Brute he arranged, he creates commotion and manages to camouflage with Inej in
it. But all of them hear a loud explosion in the House of White Rose. Kaz
thinks some external forces are getting involved. However, I think Nina could
have been the cause of it although I hope she wasn't.

### Chapter 10

The explosion in the House of White Rose had been by those winged Shu people we
read about in the first chapter. They were hunting Grisha there. Nina,
Matthias, Jesper and Wylan were escaping the commotion when they got spotted by
the flying Shu people. They wanted Nina. Wylan created a distraction and they
escaped but one of the Shu people got hold of Nina. Nina manged a close shot to
the skull of the hunter since shots on the rest of the body were futile and
then they ran for their lives.

### Chapter 11

Kaz and Inej stay at their hideout till night and then return to the cemetery.
The time they spend at the hideout is typical Kaz-Inej small talk. It's Inej
asking reasonably hopeful questions and Kaz reluctantly reminding her that she
was a great investment. They go back to the cemetry and everyone is just so
happy to see Inej back. Now, Kaz unveils his far-fetched master plan involving
climbing twenty story high silos and creating a sugar shortate so that his
recently bought shares of sugar go up to thirty million *kruge*. Why is Inej
fussing about nets? It's precautionary and not that Kaz doesn't trust her
skills. Now, due to Nina and Inej's condition to save the Grisha of the city,
Kaz has to worry about several more points of possible failure. One important
point to be noted is that Kaz specifically chose their hideout location near to
the silos just so that Inej can get a look at the terrain. Does this man even
breathe without thinking twice?

### Chapter 12

Kaz and Inej headout to itercept Per Haskell on his way home to assure him that
they are on his side. I don't like how Kaz has to lick up to Per Haskell all
the time. The scene where Per Haskell demands Inej and she disappears was
hilarious. Inej goes alone to spy on Van Eck by tricking Kaz since Kaz wanted
to accompany her. Kaz's reply to Inej when she asked him whether he would have
come for her if her legs were broken was not the complete truth. He would have
come for her but the reason was not limited to her being a part of his crew.

### Chapter 13

Nina and Matthias leave for Little Ravka in Ketterdam to inform the remaining
Grisha about their secret departure. Most of the chapter is them flirting with
each other which is kind of getting repititive. Nina tells him a story about a
Fjerdan and a Ravkan Princess and that they fall in love in the third book.
This might be a hint by the author indicating the possiblity of a third book in
this series since the story is analogous to the story of Matthias and Nina.
They are in a restaurant in Little Ravka when they are attacked (by Zoya?) and
saved by Zoya. Yes, Zoya from Shadow and Bone trilogy. Finally a crossover. Now
I have one more character to root for. Also, ther was something about Nina
controlling bones. I did not exactly understand it.

### Chapter 14

Jan Van Eck is a terrible creature. If Kaz doesn't manage to get him tortured
to death, I will dive into the book and ensure that myself and I am ready to
take any punishment by the Merchant Council. Wylan and Jesper head towards the
region where Kaz believes Wylan's mother was burried (deducted from the
documents at Smeet's house). Wylan lies to Kaz and says that only that region
offers the supply of material for his invetions. However, they are available
anywhere and he just wanted to see his mother's grave. He and Jesper head
towards Van Eck's property to see that his mother is alive and is being held in
an asylum. It is unknown whether she was mentally ill or became ill after
coming there. She doesn't recognize Wylan because of his appearance. She has
loads and loads of paintings of Wylan and the surrounding scenery. From the
little talk Wylan had with his mother, he thinks Van Eck siezed his mother's
property and put her in the asylym.

### Chapter 15

Zoya's there and Genya's there too. Two of my favourite people from the Shadow
and Bone Trilogy. They reluctantly make a deal with Matthias and Nina regarding
the rescue of the remaining Grisha. Most of the chapter is about Matthias and
Nina kissing. I mean it could have been a little less ... descriptive. Then
there is history about Matthias and his wolf and more of how Nina had behaed on
the ship struggling from her addiction of *jurda parem* kicking in. Finally it
is now that Nina is feeling better and hungry. Was it her using the new form of
power? Was it Matthias' kiss? Or was it just time? We don't know what healed
her. There is a WANTED poster about Matthias with a reward of fifty thousand
*kruge*. Lmao. As if that is something to worry about that the moment.

### Chapter 16

Kaz is amazing. He knew about Wylan's mother and he knew Wylan lied about the
supplies and he wanted Wylan to meet his mother and know the truth.

So there are WANTED posters for everyone except Nina (since Van Eck hasn't
spotted her yet with the group). But this isn't even the least of their
concerns. They all chitchat about their future plans and one by one leave for
the action of the night. Only Jesper, Kuwei and Matthias remain since they have
somethime left. They discuss about *jurda parem*. Then there is a long
description of Jesper's life back at Novyi Zem. His mother was a Grisha and she
had helped her village in every possible way. *Blessed*. They had called her.
Jesper and his parents were living happily. It was his mother who had taught
him to shoot. *Anyone can shoot. But not everyone can aim.* And she had died
trying to save the life of a little girl in her village, extracting poison from
her body but not knowing what it was doing to her own. Jesper remembered her
mother using the stalks of *jurda* to counteract the effect of *jurda* pollen.
Kuwei finds this interesting and this might be the possible lead on making the
antidote for *jurda parem*. A window pane is shattered and they have unexpected
company.

### Chapter 17

This chapter is so beautifully written. It covers a lot of Inej's history - how
she gained her skills. But there's a lot more to it. The situation of crossing
the silos is being compared to her training and her past. The sugar reminds her
of a man back in the Menagerie - it's terrible but it's beautiful.

So Nina and Inej make past the guards and Inej climbs up to the top of the silo
and uses the weevin. She crosses over to the second silo and puts weevin there
too. But throughout, there are flashbacks of her past. Her father training her.
Her performances as a part of the circus. The one time she fell because of the
nets. Her life at the Menagerie (It is disgusting how the men treated her). And
Kaz. Kaz at the Ferolind. *I will have you without armour*. She knows how Kaz
feels about her. But she also know Kaz not expressing it is the best for both
of them. Or is it? Someone grabs her from behind and shoves her down!? No one
could have dared to climb to the top. Unless you did not need to climb. It
could be the flying Shu people but we don't know yet.

### Chapter 18

Kaz is breaking into the Van Eck house once again but this time with Wylan.
Their job is to retrieve the Van Eck seal that can be used to attest the orders
for the Grisha to escape. Kaz has a big brother talk with Wylan about his
inability to read. They break the safe using Wylan's auric acid and get the
seal but are interrupted in their job by Pekka Rollins.

### Chapter 19

Matthias, Jesper and Kuwei were interrupted by the Dime Lions. They somehow
have manged to back down their location. They escape out only because of
Matthias. Jesper and Kuwei are in shock to even think straight but Matthias
takes command of the situation and helps them escape out.

### Chapter 20

Up there on the silos, Inej faces her interruptor. It is Dunyasha, a girl with
skills just like Inej's but better at everyone of them. She has also been sent
by Pekka Rollins. Inej is easily overpowered by her and is sent down from the
tightrope across the silos but there are no nets.

### Chapter 21

It is revealed that Pekka Rollins has been working with Van Eck. Kaz has to
escape the house with Wylan when the house is surrounded by the stadwatch and
the Dime Lions. Kaz spills the highly corrosive auric acid on the flor to
escape and is now worried about her Wraith.

### Chapter 22

Nina's job was to signal to Inej from below the silos. However, the Dime Lions
show up in the uniforms of the stadwatch. They are looking for Nina. They
attack her but she doesn't have the power of a Heartrenderer anymore. She has a
new power that even doesn't know of. She can control the dead. She raises the
dead bodies from the boats that she had spotted with Inej and it is this army
that saves her and Inej too by opening a net just in time to capture her fall.
All of this is super weird (controlling the dead). Even Nina mentions it. It is
unlike regular Grisha power.

### Chapter 23

Wylan's history is presented in most of this chapter. He had been looking for
employment in the Barrell and was hired by a dye manufacturer who took
advantage of his chemistry skills but didn't pay him. Kaz had heard about him
and had sent Jesper to hire him to become a demo for the Dregs. They all go to
Jesper's Da's hotel for shelter and don't know what to do next. Kuwei requests
them to hand him over since he thinks he isn't worth all the trouble. But Kaz
says that if there should be someone who is surrendered it should be him. Kaz
and Jesper have a fist fight that starts due to this. However, they don't fight
to kill since none of them use their weapons.

### Chapter 24

Inej and Jesper have a moment. Jesper talks with his Da. All that is fine. But
Jesper starts kissing Kuwei thinking that Kuwei is Wylan. And he gets spotted
by Wylan. No wonder Kaz thinks Jesper is always the one who screws up things.

### Chapter 25

Either I am too dumb or Kaz is some genius who is talking of things out of this
world. Kaz explains his final master plan involving *jurda* and Ravkans and
Kuwei being auctioned and what not. But I cannot make anything of it. I don't
understand it at all. I read it twice and how it is going to work, I do not
know. But I trust Kaz and his brain.

### Chapter 26

Okay. Okay. Okay. This one is about Kaz and Inej and what happened in the
bathroom. I know how it sounds this way but it isn't actually like that. Kaz,
after tremendous effort changed Inej's bandages while all the time struggling
to wipe the memory of his dead brother away from his mind. And then with all
the effort he could muster, he brushed his lips once against Inej. That's it. I
said it. Done. I'm here for the story mainly and not for the romance.
