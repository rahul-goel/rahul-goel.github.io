I was learning GLSL and how to draw using maths and tried to replicate a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s2SRt">famous shader program on shadertoy</a>.

For a first-timer who did it without any reference to the code, I think it turned out pretty well.

<canvas class="glslCanvas" data-fragment-url="/assets/scifi.frag" width="1000" height=1000"></canvas>
