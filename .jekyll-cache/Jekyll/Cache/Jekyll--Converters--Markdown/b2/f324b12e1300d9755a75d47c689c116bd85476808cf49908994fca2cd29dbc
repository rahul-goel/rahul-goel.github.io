I"Í<p>I actually wanted to read Six of Crows. People all over the internet said that
Six of Crows Duology is much better than the Shadow and Bone Trilogy and that
one could directly read Six of Crows Duology without even bothering with Shadow
and Bones Trilogy. After reading all this on the internet, I knew that if I
read the Six of Crows Duology first, I wouldnâ€™t have enjoyed the Shadow and
Bones Trilogy so I read that first. And then I read Six of Crows. As of now
(while writing this particular paragraph in this blog), I have only read the
first book of the duology that is Six of Crows and Iâ€™ll write my thoughts about
that. Iâ€™ll finish this blog after reading the second book and append my
thoughts.</p>
