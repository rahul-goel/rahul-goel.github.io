I"u<p>Zathura is a document viewer and I use it to view PDFs. Until now, I was using
the default inverted color mode (called recolor in zathura). It basically
flipped black to white and white to black. It was dark mode but the contrast
was so high that it still hurt my eyes. I wanted a dark mode with a dark
greyish background and a pale-brownish white foreground color.</p>
