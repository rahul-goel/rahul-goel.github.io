I"+<p>It had been such a pain to format lines when I was writing Latex/Markdown/HTML.  Since single line breaks are ignored, we can write all that we have to in a single line or multple lines. Writing in a single line always makes it tough to read later in a text editor. Since sentences are broken in between words and you have to move your eyes all across the screen. And if you want to use multiple lines, it is tough to decide where to break the lines manually. If you follow the 79 character limit, it is again hard to keep track of the characters.</p>
