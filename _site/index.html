<p>I was studying line drawing algorithms and then had an idea to replace the best
algorithm with a neural network. This long post contains an explanation of the
basic algorithms and the process I went through to mimick the best algorithm.</p>

</div>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>I actually wanted to read Six of Crows. People all over the internet said that
Six of Crows Duology is much better than the Shadow and Bone Trilogy and that
one could directly read Six of Crows Duology without even bothering with Shadow
and Bones Trilogy. After reading all this on the internet, I knew that if I
read the Six of Crows Duology first, I wouldn’t have enjoyed the Shadow and
Bones Trilogy so I read that first. And then I read Six of Crows. As of now
(while writing this particular paragraph in this blog), I have only read the
first book of the duology that is Six of Crows and I’ll write my thoughts about
that. I’ll finish this blog after reading the second book and append my
thoughts.</p>

</div>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>It had been such a pain to format lines when I was writing Latex/Markdown/HTML.  Since single line breaks are ignored, we can write all that we have to in a single line or multple lines. Writing in a single line always makes it tough to read later in a text editor. Since sentences are broken in between words and you have to move your eyes all across the screen. And if you want to use multiple lines, it is tough to decide where to break the lines manually. If you follow the 79 character limit, it is again hard to keep track of the characters.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>I read The Shadow and Bone Trilogy in a span of a week and a half if I remember
correctly. Overall, I enjoyed the experience. The story is great but it was
slow paced for me. I don’t mind the length of the books but only if they come
packed.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Zathura is a document viewer and I use it to view PDFs. Until now, I was using
the default inverted color mode (called recolor in zathura). It basically
flipped black to white and white to black. It was dark mode but the contrast
was so high that it still hurt my eyes. I wanted a dark mode with a dark
greyish background and a pale-brownish white foreground color.</p>

<p>This explains a lot. Why Pip took to pursue the Bell Disappearance Case for her project?
So Pip and her gang of friends (6 in total) are celebrating the end of term by playing Kill Joy - a murder mystery game.
Every friend is a character from the story and the story slowly unfolds as the game progresses.
There are clues, witnesses, backstory, motives and what not are presented. Each character defends himself/herself and provides an explanation.
At the end the culprit is revealed.</p>

<p>The first book was so good, I was kind of skeptical about the second book since I did not want to ruin the experience from the first one.
I am ashamed that I had such a disgusting thought in my mind.
This is the perfect sequel that could be wrtitten to the first book.</p>

<p>It is hardly the case when programming involves editing a single file. On whatever medium to big sized projects that I’ve worked upon, atleast 3 files are needed to be opened at once either to edit or for reference.
Add running docker instances and autorun servers, the number shoots up to 7 to 8.</p>
